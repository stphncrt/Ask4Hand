# Class 35 final project

This is the final project for the HackYourFuture curriculum we did as a class using the MERN stack by following the agile methodology with our team and a group of mentors. A quick guide to what we built:

> Every business has an expert. Especially in the time period we live in. Do you have a house? Who will fix it when there is a breakdown? Who will paint your house? Or do you need a website? Who will build your website? So, would you like to contact the freelancer you need directly?
Ask4Hand is the app you want. Find who you need easily. Make a comparison between freelancers and contact the ones you want directly.
Or, as a freelancer, do you want your customers to find you easily and contact you? All you have to do is sign up and that is all!

## Demo

Online deployment of this project is available at [Ask4Hand](https://c35-zzpers.herokuapp.com)

You can use the below credentials to test the app as a freelancer persona.

## 1. Setup

First, to setup all the directories run the following in the main directory:

`npm install`

`npm run setup`

The first command will install `cypress` and some small libraries needed for running the rest of the commands. The second will go into the `client` and `server` directories and set those up to be ran.

In the `client` and `server` directory there are two `.env.example` files. Create a copy and rename that to `.env`. Then follow the instructions in those files to fill in the right values.

To run the app in dev mode you can run the following command in the main directory:

`npm run dev`

### 2.1 Client structure

- `public` || public facing client code
- `__tests__` || any `jest` tests for specific components will be in a `__tests__` folder on the same level
- `__testUtils__` || any code that is only being used in the tests is put in the `__testUtils__` folder to separate that away from the rest of the code
- `api` || all of our api requests for client side that are used over multiple pages
- `components` || all of our shared components that are used over multiple pages
- `hooks` || all of our custom hooks
- `pages` || the page components of our app, any routing will go between these components
- `pages/components` || components used specifically on those pages
- `util` || any utility functions that can be used anywhere on the client side
- `App.jsx` || Our main jsx file of the client
- `App.jsx` || Our wrapper file for App.jsx of the client
- `index.jsx` || the start point of the client

### 2.2 Cypress structure

- `fixtures` || any data/files that `cypress` needs can be placed here
- `integration` || all of our tests are in here, separated in folders based on the pages in our app
- `plugins` || any plugins for our `cypress` configuration can be placed here
- `support` || custom commands and other support files for `cypress` can be placed here

### 2.3 Server structure

- `__tests__` || any `jest` tests for the api endpoints as that is our testing strategy for the backend
- `__testUtils__` || any code that is only being used in the tests is put in the `__testUtils__` folder to separate that away from the rest of the code
- `api` || all of our api requests for server side that are used over multiple pages
- `controllers` || all of our controller functions that interact with the database
- `db` || all of our configuration for the database
- `controllers` || all of our middleware functions that checks authorisation for the users
- `models` || all of our `mongoose` models will be placed here
- `routes` || code to match up the API with our controllers
- `util` || any utility functions that can be used anywhere on the server side
- `index.js` || the start point of the server

## 3. Stack / external libraries

The base stack of the app is a MERN stack (Mongoose, Express, React, Node). Next to that we make use of the following extras:

- `prettier` || To automatically format our code. See [docs](https://prettier.io/)
- `concurrently` || To run commands in parallel. See [docs](https://github.com/open-cli-tools/concurrently#readme)
